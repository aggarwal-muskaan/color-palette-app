# color-palette-app 😀

## About

I have made this project from Colt Steele's course on Modern React Bootcamp.  
I have used class-based components along with React libraries.
**_The app provides you with some palettes and a option to make your own._**

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aggarwal-muskaan/color-palette-app.git
cd [foldername]
git npm
```

## Libraries

I've used these React Libraries in my project :

1. react-copy-to-clipboard
1. rc-slider
1. react-color
1. react-soratble-hoc
1. react-transition-group
1. chroma-js
1. emoji-mart
1. react-material-ui-form-validator

## Additional Features

I have tried to add features to this project.

- Redirecting URLs
- Preventing Random Colors from duplicates.
- Used Sketch Picker for selecting colors.
- [SVG background](https://www.svgbackgrounds.com/) to Homepage.

## Demo

![app in action](src/demo.gif)  
_Uses Local Storage for storing customized palettes._  
Give it a shot.😅

## Loophole

The palette have a limit of 20 colors only.

## Build with

- React
- Material-UI  
   And most importantly 😁, with the passion to learn and grow.

## Style Issues 😥

I tried hard to reslove style bugs from this app.  
Love to listen solution if you have one.  
When the onClick event is fired by clicking 'Create New Palette' link on homepage's navbar, it deforms the styling on homepage.  
(Like, Height of Navbar get decrease & delete icon on Minipalettes get disappear)

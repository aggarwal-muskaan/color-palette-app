## About

I have made this project from Colt Steele's course on Modern React Bootcamp.  
I have used class-based components along with React libraries.  
**_The app provides you with some palettes and a option to make your own._**  
You can choose color format: hex-#fff, rgb(0,0,0) or rgba(255,255,255,0.4).

## Build with

## Style Issues üò•

I tried hard to reslove style bugs from this app.  
Love to listen solution if you have one.  
When the onClick event is fired by clicking 'Create New Palette' link on homepage's navbar, it deforms the styling on homepage.  
(Like, Height of Navbar get decrease & delete icon on Minipalettes get disappear)
